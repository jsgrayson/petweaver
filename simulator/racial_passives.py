Racial Passive System for Pet Battle Simulator

Implements the racial passive abilities for all 10 pet families.
These are core mechanics that apply to every pet based on their family type.

References:
- Undead: Revive for 1 turn when killed (Shadowlands mechanic)
- Magic: Cannot take more than 35% max HP in one hit
- Mechanical: Revive once per battle to 20% HP
- And 7 others...

        Wait, the previous implementation was: "Immune to CC".
        The damage part was removed in the new spec?
        Old spec: "+50% damage above 50% HP" (This was standard WoW logic).
        New spec: "Immune to stun, root, and sleep effects."
        
        We need to keep the damage part if it's still valid, but the user explicitly listed "Immune to stun..."
        The table in the prompt says:
        | Critter | Critter | Immune to stun, root, and sleep effects. |
        
        It does NOT mention the damage bonus.
        However, standard WoW Critter passive IS immunity to CC.
        The "damage bonus" I implemented earlier might have been a misunderstanding or from a different version?
        Actually, standard WoW Critter passive is "Immune to CC".
        The "damage bonus" I implemented was likely incorrect or from a mod.
        I will REMOVE the damage bonus and implement the CC immunity check.
        
        But this method returns a float (damage mod).
        I should change it to return 1.0 (no damage mod) and handle CC immunity in buff_tracker.
